During my internship at [Nabu Casa][nc] in the first half of 2021, I focused on energy management for your house, how to collect all energy data and display it on a dashboard. Since Home Assistant release **2021.8** it's possible to use the [Home Assistant Energy][energy] dashboard to display your energy usage. Unfortunately, not everyone has a smart meter and/or is equipped with a P1 port. This is where the Home Assistant Glow comes in!

Home Assistant Glow makes a *(not so)* smart meter without a P1 port easily readable, reading the pulse LED that is always present in most cases and it works with [ESPHome][esphome]! To neatly hide it all in your meter cupboard, a case has been designed that you can 3D print yourself.

### How do I know if my meter is supported?

To make sure your meter will work with the Home Assistant Glow, you have to look for the `imp/kWh` rate on your meter (see picture). Make a note of this value because you may need it later when configuring your device.
