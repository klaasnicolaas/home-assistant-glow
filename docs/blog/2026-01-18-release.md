## ESP32-C3 Support

The Home Assistant Glow now officially supports the ESP32-C3 board! This compact and energy-efficient variant of the ESP32 family is now available as a configuration option.

If you're building your own Glow or looking to upgrade, the ESP32-C3 is now a fully supported option alongside the existing ESP32 and ESP8266 boards.

:::tip 3D Case Designs Welcome
If you've designed a 3D-printed case for the ESP32-C3 variant, we'd love to add it to our [3D Cases resource page](/docs/resources/cases)! Feel free to share your design via a [discussion](https://github.com/klaasnicolaas/home-assistant-glow/discussions) or [pull request](https://github.com/klaasnicolaas/home-assistant-glow/pulls).

## ESP32 Configuration Updates

The ESP32 configuration has received significant improvements in this release:

- **ESP-IDF Framework**: The ESP32 build now uses the esp-idf framework instead of arduino, providing better performance and more stability
- **Board Variant Support**: Proper board variant configuration has been added for better hardware compatibility

These changes ensure that your ESP32-based Glow device runs more efficiently and reliably.

## Documentation Overhaul

We've made extensive improvements to the documentation to help you get the most out of your Glow device:

### New Content

- **Reverting to Default Firmware**: Complete guide on how to return to the default firmware if you've adopted your device in ESPHome Builder
- **Finding Component IDs**: Documentation listing commonly used component IDs (like `sensor_energy_pulse_meter`, `status_led`, `ota_esphome`) to help you customize your device
- **Avoiding Encryption Key Issues**: New FAQ section explaining when to stick with default firmware vs. when to adopt in ESPHome Builder

### Improved Page Structure

The documentation structure has been refined to make it easier to find the information you need:

- **Getting Started**: Streamlined onboarding process with clearer step-by-step instructions
- **Advanced Sections**: Firmware updates and customization guides now have better organization with dedicated sections for different use cases
- **FAQ Pages**: Updated with practical solutions and cross-references to related documentation

## Pulse Rate Configuration

The pulse rate configuration has been adjusted for better usability:
- Minimum value changed to 10 (from lower values)
- Step size set to 10 for easier selection

This makes it simpler to configure the pulse rate for common energy meters.

## Wrap up

This release focuses on expanding hardware support and making the documentation more accessible and helpful. Whether you're setting up a new Glow device or customizing an existing one, the improved documentation should make the process much smoother.
