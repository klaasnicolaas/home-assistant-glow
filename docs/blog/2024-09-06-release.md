I'm excited to announce the release of version 4.2.0 of the Home Assistant Glow ðŸŒŸ. It's a small release this time, built on the latest version of ESPHome (2024.8.x) and contains mostly dependency updates for Docusaurus.

## Moved to Web Server layout V3

The Home Assistant Glow has been upgraded to version 3 of the [web server][webserver] component. This latest version features a fresh design that is more user-friendly and responsive. You can now double-click on tabs to enlarge them, and the layout is optimized for a better mobile experience.

:::note
If you don't like the new layout, you can override the web server version in your configuration by using [!extend]. For example, to use the old layout, you can use the following configuration:

```yaml title="your_glow_config.yaml"
web_server:
  - id: !extend esphome_web_server
    version: 2
```
