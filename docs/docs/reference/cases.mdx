# Cases

On this page you will find all the cases that you can 3D print for the Home Assistant Glow. If you've made some changes on the cases, I'd appreciate it if you add the new case design to the repository for everyone to benefit üòâ

## Photodiode PCB

This case consists of 2 parts, a top and bottom where you can slide the parts over each other. If you would like to make adjustments to the original design, you can download and use the [STEP](/cases/Home_Assistant_Glow.step) file.

This case consists of 2 parts, a top and bottom where you can slide the parts over each other. In a way that leaves room for the Dupont jumper cables. If you would like to make adjustments to the original design, you can download and use the [STEP](/cases/Home_Assistant_Glow.step) file.
