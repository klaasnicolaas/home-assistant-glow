# Diagrams

On this page you will find GPIO pin tables for the Photodiode and Status LED, as well as a wiring diagram of how everything is connected.

## Wiring diagram

Below you will find a wiring diagram of how everything is connected, depending on the type of board you use, the [GPIO pins](#gpio-pins) may be in a different place. You could also omit the status LED if desired.

## GPIO pins

In the tables below you will find more information, about how to connect the Photodiode PCB and the status LED.

### Photodiode

How the Photodiode is connected to the ESP board of your choice.

| PHOTODIODE | ESP32        | Wemos D1 / ESP8266 |
|------------|--------------|--------------------|
| A0         | NOT USING    | NOT USING          |
| DO         | D26 (GPIO26) | D7 (GPIO13)        |
| VCC        | 3V3          | 3V3                |
| GND        | GND          | GND                |

### Status LED

How the status LED is connected to the ESP board of your choice. For each measured pulse, the LED will briefly flash <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>*red*</span> and in case of no WiFi connection, the LED will continue to flash <span style={{ color: 'blue' }}>*blue*</span>.

| LED    | ESP32      | D1 mini / ESP8266 |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| RED    | D2 (GPIO2) | D4 (GPIO2)        |
| GREEN  | D4 (GPIO4) | D2 (GPIO4)        |
| BLUE   | D5 (GPIO5) | D1 (GPIO5)        |
| GND    | GND        | GND               |
